Data Visualisations in JavaScript

Code for SPA2012 talk: http://www.spaconference.org/spa2012/sessions/session412.html
There are slides from the talk here: http://www.slideshare.net/annashipman/data-visualisations-in-iavascript

This repo contains demos for how to create three visualisations:

 - a sunburst using JIT
 - a nightingale using Raphael 
 - a dynamic stacked barchart using d3.

Each folder contains the html file to display the visualisation, the file to include, a complete version of the file to include (i.e. just change the html so it includes *_complete.js to skip to the end), and a cheat sheet listing you the steps from blank to complete. 

However, the easiest way to understand the demos is to step through the branches, from master to 6. Check out the next numbered branch, see what has changed in the js file and see what has changed in the visualisation.
